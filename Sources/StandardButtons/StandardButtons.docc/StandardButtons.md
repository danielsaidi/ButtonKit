StandardButtons is a SwiftUI library that makes it easy to create standard button types.


## Overview

![Library logotype](Logo.png)

StandardButtons is a SwiftUI library that lets you create standard button types, with localized titles, icons, roles and keyboard shortcuts.

StandardButtons defines **110+** standard button types, like ``StandardButtonType/add``, ``StandardButtonType/delete``, ``StandardButtonType/edit``, ``StandardButtonType/done``, etc. Each button type has a localized ``StandardButtonType/title``, an ``StandardButtonType/image``, and a ``StandardButtonType/role``, as well as an optional ``StandardButtonType/keyboardShortcut``.


## Installation

StandardButtons can be installed with the Swift Package Manager:

## Support My Work

You can [become a sponsor][Sponsors] to help me dedicate more time on my various [open-source tools][OpenSource]. Every contribution, no matter the size, makes a real difference in keeping these tools free and actively developed.



## Getting started

With StandardButtons, just `import StandardButtons` and use ``SwiftUI/Button``. ``SwiftUI/Button/init(_:action:)`` to create a standard button view:

```swift
Button(.add)Â { 
    // Add your custom add logic here
}
```

The code above will render a regular SwiftUI ``SwiftUI/Button`` and works on all major Apple platforms (iOS, macOS, tvOS, watchOS, visionOS).

* ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡° Danish
