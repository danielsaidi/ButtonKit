# Release Notes

ButtonKit will use semver after 1.0. 

Until then, breaking changes can happen in any version, and deprecated features may be removed in any minor version bump.


## 0.1

This version adds a new `StandardButtonType`.

You can use this with the `Button` initializer, to create a standard button.
